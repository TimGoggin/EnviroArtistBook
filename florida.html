        <p class = "paragraph" id = "p1">Many Florida politicians have ran campaigns on destroying the Everglades to make way for space that is easier to farm and build on. This has resulted in over half of the original Everglades being destroyed for agricultural purposes. This is an example of habitat destruction.</p>
